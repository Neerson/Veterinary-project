## Overview
# Veterinary Data Analysis: Predicting Pet Diseases
This project analyzes a veterinary dataset to predict common pet diseases using machine learning. The dataset includes information on pet demographics, medical history, and diagnostic results.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Check source data folder
- **Size**: 10,000 records
- **Features**: Age, breed, weight, symptoms, diagnostic results

## Objectives
- Identify key factors contributing to pet diseases.
- Build a predictive model to classify diseases.

## Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models

## Results
- Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting diseases.
- Found that age and weight are the most significant predictors.
